# Reverse Words in a String

## Problem Statement
The task is to reverse the words in a given string while maintaining the original order of characters within each word. Extra spaces between words should be removed.

## Algorithm
1. **Input String**: The function takes a string `s` as input.
2. **Split the String**: Use `split(" ")` to divide the string into an array of words (`arr`).
3. **Initialize StringBuilder**: Create a `StringBuilder` instance (`sb`) to build the final reversed string.
4. **Reverse Iteration**: Iterate through the array of words from the last word to the first:
   - Check if the current word is not empty (`!arr[i].isEmpty()`).
   - If the word is not empty, append it to the `StringBuilder`.
   - If it is not the last word (`i != 0`), append a space after the word.
5. **Return Result**: Convert the `StringBuilder` to a string using `toString()` and use `trim()` to remove any leading or trailing spaces before returning the final result.

## Code Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        // Split the input string into an array of words based on spaces
        String[] arr = s.split(" ");
        // Create a StringBuilder to construct the reversed string
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        // Iterate from the last word to the first
        for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Check if the current word is not empty
            if (!arr[i].isEmpty()) {
                // Append the word to the StringBuilder
                sb.append(arr[i]);
                // Append a space if it's not the last word
                if (i != 0) {
                    sb.append(" ");
                }
            }
        }

        // Convert the StringBuilder to a string and trim any leading/trailing spaces
        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}

# Explanation of the Code

## Handling Extra Spaces
The code checks for empty strings (`!arr[i].isEmpty()`) to handle cases where there may be multiple spaces between words.

## StringBuilder
Using `StringBuilder` is more efficient than using string concatenation, especially in a loop, because it reduces the number of temporary string objects created.

## Trim Method
The use of `trim()` ensures that the result does not have any leading or trailing spaces.

# Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the entire string once for splitting and once for building the result.

# Space Complexity
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is also O(n) because we store the split words in an array and use a `StringBuilder` to build the final output string. In the worst case, all characters could be words, leading to the need for storage proportional to the input size.
